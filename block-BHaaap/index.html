### Create a web page with the following characteristics:


3. After the paragraph add an image having all the corner rounded.
5. At the bottom of the page, there must be a footer containing few links.
7. The paragraph is contained in 600px by 400px boxes with 2px black dotted borders and background color #D1D631
8. Links have a 3px blue dashed border on the bottom only and background color #A1A1A1

- Using CSS resets is necessary.
- Use semantic tags and keep the nesting and indentation proper.

            <p>The area of Machine Learning deals with the design of programs that can learn rules from
                data, adapt to changes, and improve performance with experience. In addition to being
                one of the initial dreams of Computer Science, Machine Learning has become crucial as
                computers are expected to solve increasingly complex problems and become more integrated
                into our daily lives.
                Writing a computer program is a bit like writing down instructions for an extremely
                literal child who just happens to be millions of times faster than you. Yet many of the
                problems we now want computers to solve are no longer tasks we know how to explicitly
                tell a computer how to do. These include identifying faces in images, autonomous driving in
                the desert, finding relevant documents in a database (or throwing out irrelevant ones, such
                as spam email), finding patterns in large volumes of scientific data, and adjusting internal
                parameters of systems to optimize performance. That is, we may ourselves be good at
                identifying people in photographs, but we do not know how to directly tell a computer how
                to do it. Instead, methods that take labeled training data (images labeled by who is in them,
                or email messages labeled by whether or not they are spam) and then learn appropriate rules
                from the data, seem to be the best approaches to solving these problems. Furthermore, we
                need systems that can adapt to changing conditions, that can be user-friendly by adapting
                to needs of their individual users, and that can improve performance over time.
